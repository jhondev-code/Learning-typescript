On this occasion I decided to learn and master the programming language created by Microsoft, I am talking about TypeScript, which I read in forums and heard from the community that it was a language based on javascript but much more beautiful and with the characteristic of having typed. This repository contains my steps ðŸ‘ž and the learning path I followed to master ðŸ§  the TypeScript programming language.

## Description
TypeScript programming language source code that I developed while following the path to learn it

## Motivations
I decided to learn TypeScript because of the following things that I found out about:

- A cleaner and more unique syntax.
- Possibility of using static typing, since this facilitates the code reading.
- Used to create projects with angular.
- The ability to run on the DenoJS runtime.
- Simplify projects made in javascript.
- A more solid OOP model.
- And many more...
